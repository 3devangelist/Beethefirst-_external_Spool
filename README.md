Other external spool holder for Bee The First and Bee The First Plus.

# 3D Print Considerations

You should use at lest 20% infill and a medium resolution, but if you want make shore 40% infill is a safe option.
See the image that is on repository to check part orientation. The Gcode present on repository was made to print PETG, on glass with 3DLAC, keep that in mind.


# 3D modeling

I have used Rhinocerus 4.0, to model the spool holder, you can edit it or import the step or stl to your program of choice!
